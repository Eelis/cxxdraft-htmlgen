Introduction

  cxxdraft-htmlgen parses the LaTeX sources of the draft,
  and generates static HTML pages from them.

Prerequisites

  - Git
  - The Haskell Platform (https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  - Graphviz
  - Node.js
  - The 'split' NPM package
  - mathjax-node-cli (https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-node-cli/)

Usage

  Do:
    git clone https://github.com/Eelis/cxxdraft-htmlgen.git
    cd cxxdraft-htmlgen
    cabal build
    dist/build/cxxdraft-htmlgen/cxxdraft-htmlgen path/to/draft [sectionfilestyle]

  Or with stack:
    stack build
    stack exec cxxdraft-htmlgen path/to/draft [sectionfilestyle]

  The sectionfilestyle parameter is one of:

    Bare            (to generate e.g. intro.execution)
    WithExtension   (to generate e.g. intro.execution.html)
    InSubdir        (to generate e.g. intro.execution/index.html)

  The default is WithExtension, since this is suitable
  for direct browsing on a filesystem without a web server.

  Bare may be used in conjunction with web server configuration
  specifying a default text/html mime type for the directory
  containing the section pages, to get URLs such as:

    temp.res#temp.dep
    temp.dep#3

  InSubdir only requires defaulting to index.html, to give:

    temp.res/#temp.dep
    temp.dep/#3

Custom draft branch

  While cxxdraft-htmlgen works with the official draft sources as-is,
  better results can be obtained by using the following branch:

    https://github.com/Eelis/draft/tree/cxxdraft-htmlgen-fixes

  This branch tracks the official draft sources, but makes some changes to:
    - improve syntax highlighting
    - clean up hyperlinks
    - work around MathJax limitations
    - work around cxxdraft-htmlgen limitations

Output

  The following will be created in ./14882/ :

  - index.html    A table of contents with links to...

  - ~2300 interlinked section pages

    These are named after the section abbreviation, which for
    the Bare section file style look like:

      stmt.goto
      class.member.lookup
      cpp
      iterator.requirements.general
      locale.moneypunct.virtuals

    Since sections nest, content is duplicated at every level.
    This allows one to specify more or less context for a given
    citation. For example, one can link to:

      basic.scope.hiding   (section 6.4.10 "Name hiding" on
                            a page of its own)

      basic.scope#hiding   (the same section highlighted on
                            the page for section 6.4 "Scope")

      basic#scope.hiding   (the same section highlighted on
                            the page for chapter 6 "Basics")

  - full         The entire document (~24 mbyte, or ~2 mbyte compressed).

  - 14882.css    Used by all of the above.

Hidden links

  On any page:

  - "Note:" and "Example:" tags are links that select the note (resp. example);

  - defined terms/concepts/nonterminals are links that select themselves;

  - a full stop at the end of a sentence is a link that selects the sentence;

  - moving the mouse over the right margin of a numbered paragraph reveals a link
    to the LaTeX source for that paragraph;

  - moving the mouse over the left margin of an itemdecl reveals a link
    that selects the itemdecl.

Todo

  - table meta.unary.prop#tab:type-traits.properties is horribly
    wide due to lack of hyphenation
  - don't generate anchors with duplicate ids for index entries with
    the same key
