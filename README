Introduction

  genhtml parses the LaTeX sources of the draft, and generates
  a HTML version, with figures embedded as inline SVG.

Prerequisites

  - various Hackage packages
  - graphviz
  - dvipng
  - latex

Usage

  runhaskell genhtml.hs path/to/draft [sectionfilestyle]

  Where sectionfilestyle is one of:

    Bare            (to generate e.g. intro.execution)
    WithExtension   (to generate e.g. intro.execution.html)
    InSubdir        (to generate e.g. intro.execution/index.html)

  The default is WithExtension, since this is suitable
  for direct browsing on a filesystem without a web server.

  Bare may be used in conjunction with web server configuration
  specifying a default text/html mime type for the directory
  containing the section pages, to get URLs such as:

    temp.res#temp.dep
    temp.dep#3

  InSubdir only requires defaulting to index.html, to give:

    temp.res/#temp.dep
    temp.dep/#3

Output

  The following will be created in ./14882/ :

  - index.html    A long table of contents with links to...

  - ~1660 interlinked section pages

    These are named after the section abbrevation, which for
    the Bare section file style look like:

      stmt.goto
      class.member.lookup
      cpp
      iterator.requirements.general
      locale.moneypunct.virtuals

    Since sections nest, content is duplicated at every level.
    This allows one to specify more or less context for a given
    section or paragraph citation. For example, one can link to:

      temp.dep            (section 14.6.2 "Dependent names")

      temp.res#temp.dep   (the same section highlighted on the
                                page for section 14.6 "Name resolution")

      temp#temp.dep       (the same section highlighted on the
                                page for chapter 14 "Templates")

      full#temp.dep       (see below)

  - full         ~6 mbyte, the entire draft.

  - 14882.css    Used by all of the above.

  - math/        Subdirectory with .png images containing rendered
                 mathematical formulas.

Todo

  - indentation for itemdescrs
  - index
  - footnote numbers
  - list required hackage packages in prereqs
  - minipages side-by-side
  - comments in code supposed to be italic
  - paragraphs include wrong code in library chapters
  - different kinds of enumeration
  - align paragraph numbers vertically with text
  - split genhtml.hs up
