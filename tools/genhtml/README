Introduction

  genhtml parses the LaTeX sources of the draft, and generates
  a HTML version, with figures embedded as inline SVG.

Prerequisites

  - various Hackage packages
  - graphviz

Usage

  In this directory, run:

    runhaskell genhtml.hs

Output

  The following will be created in 14882/ :

  - index.html    A long table of contents with links to...

  - 1662 interlinked section pages

    These are named after the section abbrevation, e.g.:

      stmt.goto.html
      class.member.lookup.html
      cpp.html
      iterator.requirements.general.html
      locale.moneypunct.virtuals.html

    Since sections nest, content is duplicated at every level.
    This allows one to specify more or less context for a given
    section or paragraph citation. For example, one can link to:

      temp.dep.html            (section 14.6.2 "Dependent names")

      temp.res.html#temp.dep   (the same section highlighted on the
                                page for section 14.6 "Name resolution")

      temp.html#temp.dep       (the same section highlighted on the
                                page for chapter 14 "Templates")

      full.html#temp.dep       (see below)

    On a given section's page, the abbreviation link for /that/ section
    links back to the table of contents.

  - full.html    ~6 mbyte, the entire draft.

  - 14882.css    Used by all of the above.

  There is a setting in the code which can be used to generate either
  files without the '.html' extension, or files called 'index.html'
  in subdirectories. The former may be used in conjunction with webserver
  configuration specifying a default text/html mime type for the directory
  containing the section pages, to get URLs like:

    temp.res#temp.dep
    temp.dep#3
